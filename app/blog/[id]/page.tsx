      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Power of Integrated Marketing</h2>
      <p>The most successful marketing strategies combine both online and offline channels. This integrated approach ensures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consistent brand messaging across all touchpoints</li>
        <li>Maximum reach across different audience segments</li>
        <li>Reinforced brand recall through multiple exposure points</li>
        <li>Enhanced credibility through diverse marketing channels</li>
